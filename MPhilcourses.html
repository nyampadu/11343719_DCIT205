            <p>The Department of Computer Science – University of Ghana currently runs Masters of Science (MSc.) in
                Computer Science and Master of Philosophy (MPhil.) in Computer Science.

                The MSc. is a 1-year (weekend/evening) programme with a capstone project while the MPhil is a 2-year
                (full-time) programme. The first year of the MPhil is taught course and second year is research and
                dissertation. Both programmes are accelerated master’s programme specially designed to train current and
                future computer scientist who are available for full-time or part-time study.

                Students enrolled in these programmes are equipped with broader knowledge in theoretical computer
                science and advance technical skills to approach science in technology as a disruptive force to manage
                complex problems of the global society. At the end of these programmes, students will gain hands-on
                experience in solving complex, and unstructured scientific problems while learning subjects like Advance
                Databases, Advance Data Structures and Algorithms and Networks</p>
